## üíø FRONTEND Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone [repository_url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd [YOUR-REPO-NAME]
```

3. The project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Having them installed, type into the terminal:

```
npm i
```

4. Create .env in main folder and paste empty variables from .env.example

5. Create firebase project

6. Initialize firebase project

```
firebase init
```

7. Paste data to variables in .env

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_KEY=
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_APP_ID=
```

8. Initialize firebase database and past address to variable in .env for example:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_URL=https://project-name-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app
```

9. Set firebase database rules:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": false
  }
}
```

10. Create navList object in firebase database and import ./assets/data/navList (disclaimer: navigation data are fetching because of the option "adding new products categories". The option will be available in the future administration panel)
